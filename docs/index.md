**Motivation**
A key aspect of a data scientist’s work involves managing and maintaining a reliable development environment. Keeping the development environment up-to-date and closely aligned with the production environment ensures smoother workflows. When these environments diverge, issues can quickly arise. In larger settings, proficiency with CI/CD pipelines and DevOps practices becomes highly beneficial. A data scientist’s primary goal is to deliver solutions that are easy to integrate and deploy into production seamlessly.
